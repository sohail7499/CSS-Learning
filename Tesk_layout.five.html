                     HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language 
                    for creating webpages. It structures content on the web using
                    element slike headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the standard language for styling webpages.
                    It controls the look and layout of HTML elements, including colors, fonts,
                    spacing, backgrounds, and more. With CSS, websites become visually appealing,
                    responsive, and user-friendly across different devices.

                    JavaScript is a powerful programming language that brings interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. Unlike HTML, which provides structure, and CSS, which handles design, JavaScript allows developers to create features such as form validation, animations, sliders, dropdown menus, and interactive content that responds to user actions in real time. It runs directly in the browser, making web pages more engaging and functional, and is also widely used in server-side development, mobile apps, and even game development.
